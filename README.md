# OSCP-Prep-Tool-Collection
My personal collection of OSCP related tools I have used, or would like to try, directly in the OSCP PWK 2020 updated labs. 
If a tool has helped me root a box in some way, I'll leave a link and notes if/when possible. 
NO OSCP EXAM SPOILERS OF ANY KIND, though I may start a section for exploit PoCs.
